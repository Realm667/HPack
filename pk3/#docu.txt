SPARKLE FOUNTAINS
=================
Place on map and use the first two arguments to control the 
intensity and area of the spawner. The original was a 64x64 
square.

First argument controls the size of the area. 32, for example, 
spawns in a 64x64 square (or 64 diameter circle. See second 
argument).

Second argument controls the type of area it spawns in. 0 is 
square, 1 is circle.

It should be noted that pngs can't be translated like normal 
graphics. Because of this, if you convert the SPFXA0 sprite to 
a png, the spawners will spawn white effects. Use Doom's lmp format, 
instead.

STEAM GENERATORS
================
Place on map and use the first four arguments to change 
behavior.

First argument controls direction. 0 is up, 1 is down, 2 is 
forward. For best results, down-pointing spawners should be placed 
2 or 3 map units below the ceiling.

Second argument chooses if it's a constant spawner, or spawns in 
bursts. Burst spawners use the third argument and play a different sound.

Third argument controls the frequency of the bursts (divided by 16. 
I.e, 128 will end up as 8). This is only used by the second argument.

Fourth argument silences the spawner. 0 will play the sound, 1 will not.

THUNDER
=======
Place them on the map and deactivate them with the DORMANT flag, 
then activate them in certain intervals with some looping acs script.

EMBER
=====
Place on map and use the first two arguments to control the intensity 
and area of the spawner.

First argument controls the size of the area. 32, for example, spawns 
in a 64x64 square (or 64 diameter circle. See second argument).

Second argument controls the type of area it spawns in. 0 is 
square, 1 is circle.

Third argument controls it's frequency. The lower the number, 
the heavier the ember count.

FIRE
====
Place on map and use the first argument to control the size of the 
fire. 0 is small, 1 is medium, 2 and above is large.

The second argument prevents it from playing sounds. 0 will play 
the sounds, 1 will not.

RAIN
====
Place the RainDropSpawner on your map, and use values set on the 
specials tab to modify it 

The first argument controls it's area. 128, for example makes 
it a 256x256 square or 256-radius circle (See fourth argument)

The second argument controls it's frequency. The lower the number, 
the heavier the rainfall

The third argument controls whether or not it plays it's ambient 
sound. 0 will play the sound, 1 will not

The fourth argument controls the area type. 0 is a square, 1 is 
a circle

SNOW
====
Place on map and use the first three arguments to control 
the intensity and area of the spawner.

First argument controls the size of the area. 128, for example, 
spawns in a 256x256 square (or 256 diameter circle. See third argument).

Second argument controls the frequency of which it spawns snow. 
The lower the number, the more frequent (0 for always).

Third argument controls the type of area it spawns in. 0 is
square, 1 is circle.

DRY ICE FOG
===========

Place these fog actors in large tight groups
to create a blanket of ankle-level fog. There are several colours
to choose from.

HAND STATUE
===========

The value of the first argument determines the color; the first four 
correspond quite closely to the colors of the key gizmos.
	00: Red
	01: Yellow
	02: Green
	03: Blue
	04: Orange
	05: Purple
	06: White
	07: Black
	08: Orange-red
	09: Bright yellow
