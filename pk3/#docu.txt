STAR SPAWNERS
=============
Place on map and use the second and third
arguments to control the intensity and area of 
the spawner.

First argument is not used.

Second argument controls the size of the area. 
32 for example, spawns in a 64x64x64 cube.

Third argument controls the chance of sparkles 
being spawned. 255 spawns no sparkles at all.

It should be noted that pngs can't be translated 
like normal graphics. Because of this, if
you convert the SKFXA0 sprite to a png, the spawners 
will spawn white effects. Use Doom's lmp format, 
instead.

SPARKLE FOUNTAINS
=================
Place on map and use the first two arguments to control the 
intensity and area of the spawner. The original was a 64x64 
square.

First argument controls the size of the area. 32, for example, 
spawns in a 64x64 square (or 64 diameter circle. See second 
argument).

Second argument controls the type of area it spawns in. 0 is 
square, 1 is circle.

The third argument controls the vertical spread. A value of 0
means to use the default, that is to say, eight units above the
actor's position. Otherwise, the spread will be twice the value
given above the actor's position.

The fourth argument controls the behavior of the sparkles. 
With 0, they move at constant speed; with 1 they accelerate in 
the same way as Heretic's stock "teleport glitter" sparkles.

It should be noted that pngs can't be translated like normal 
graphics. Because of this, if you convert the PTCL* sprite
to a png, the spawners will spawn white effects. Use Doom's 
lmp format, instead.

RANDOM STAR FOUNTAINS
=====================
This is an alternative to the sparkle fountain. It will randomly
spawn four types of particles: glitter (identical to Heretic teleport 
glitter), sparkles and accelerating sparkles (from sparkle fountain)
and slow-moving stars (from star spawner, but with a slight upward
movement).

The first argument controls the size of the area. 32, for example, 
results in a circle with a radius of 32 units. If left to 0, the 
default value of 16 will be used.

The second argument is not used.

The third argument controls the vertical spread. The particles will
appear randomly at any point between the thing itself and twice that
value above it. If left to 0, the default value of 4 will be used.

The fourth argument controls the colors of the particles:
	1 is red
	2 is blue
	4 is yellow
	8 is green
	16 is purple
	32 is white
These values can be combined, for example 21 will result in red, 
yellow and purple particles. If left to 0, the default value of
63 is used, giving a fountain of all colors.

STEAM GENERATORS
================
Place on map and use the first four arguments to change 
behavior.

First argument controls direction. 0 is up, 1 is down, 2 is 
forward. For best results, down-pointing spawners should be placed 
2 or 3 map units below the ceiling.

Second argument chooses if it's a constant spawner, or spawns in 
bursts. Burst spawners use the third argument and play a different sound.

Third argument controls the frequency of the bursts (divided by 16. 
I.e, 128 will end up as 8). This is only used by the second argument.

Fourth argument silences the spawner. 0 will play the sound, 1 will not.

THUNDER
=======
Place them on the map and deactivate them with the DORMANT flag, 
then activate them in certain intervals with some looping acs script.

EMBER
=====
Place on map and use the first two arguments to control the intensity 
and area of the spawner.

First argument controls the size of the area. 32, for example, spawns 
in a 64x64 square (or 64 diameter circle. See second argument).

Second argument controls the type of area it spawns in. 0 is 
square, 1 is circle.

Third argument controls its frequency. The lower the number, 
the heavier the ember count.

FIRE
====
Place on map and use the first argument to control the size of the 
fire. 0 is small, 1 is medium, 2 and above is large.

The second argument prevents it from playing sounds. 0 will play 
the sounds, 1 will not.

RAIN
====
Place the RainDropSpawner on your map, and use values set on the 
specials tab to modify it 

The first argument controls it's area. 128, for example makes 
it a 256x256 square or 256-radius circle (See fourth argument)

The second argument controls it's frequency. The lower the number, 
the heavier the rainfall

The third argument controls whether or not it plays it's ambient 
sound. 0 will play the sound, 1 will not

The fourth argument controls the area type. 0 is a square, 1 is 
a circle

SNOW
====
Place on map and use the first three arguments to control 
the intensity and area of the spawner.

First argument controls the size of the area. 128, for example, 
spawns in a 256x256 square (or 256 diameter circle. See third argument).

Second argument controls the frequency of which it spawns snow. 
The lower the number, the more frequent (0 for always).

Third argument controls the type of area it spawns in. 0 is
square, 1 is circle.

DRY ICE FOG
===========

Place these fog actors in large tight groups
to create a blanket of ankle-level fog. There are several colours
to choose from.

HAND STATUE
===========

The value of the first argument determines the color; the first four 
correspond quite closely to the colors of the key gizmos.
	00: Red
	01: Yellow
	02: Green
	03: Blue
	04: Orange
	05: Purple
	06: White
	07: Black
	08: Orange-red
	09: Bright yellow
	10: Lime green
	11: Cobalt blue
	12: Pink
