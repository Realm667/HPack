Usage: zdwadconv <source.wad> <output.wad>

This program converts every map in the source.wad into the
enhanced format supported by ZDoom. This is essentially what
the game does when it loads a normal Doom map. However, Zdoom
is free to use certain tricks which this program can't, so it
is possible that some maps will not convert successfully.
this is an external utility, it may not be possible to
convert every map perfectly. The file convlog.txt will
contain a copy of every message printed to the screen during
the conversion and should be checked if something went wring.
